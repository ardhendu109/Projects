This repository showcases some of my projects. More updates will come..

### Wheat Head Detection Challange: 
1. The jupyter notebook contains the code for this project.
2. There is also a detailed project report in PDF format.

This project focuses on detecting wheat heads form outdoor field images.
Images of farming fields can be messy due to air flow, sunlight and the difficulties associated
with photographing such fields. This makes detecting the wheat heads much more difficult.
In this project I have used Faster RCNN with ResNet50 as the backbone architecture and RPN (Region Proposla Network)
for proposing and detecting the bounding boxes around the wheat heads.
